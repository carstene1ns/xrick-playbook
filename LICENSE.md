Here you can find license information about the various parts of this project.
This port uses different libraries and assets. It can be compiled using the
SDK/NDK provided by Blackberry/RIM and has not much code of its own. The code
written by me is under the same license as the original source.

LICENSE AGREEMENT & LEGAL BABLE

I have written the xrick code. However, graphics and maps and sounds are by the
authors of the original Rick Dangerous game, and "Rick Dangerous" remains a
trademark of its owner(s) -- maybe Core Design (who wrote the game) or FireBird
(who published it). As of today, I have not been successful at contacting Core
Design.

This makes it a bit difficult to formally release the whole code, including
data for graphics and maps and sounds, under the terms of licences such as the
GNU General Public Licence. So the code is released "in the spirit" of the GNU
GPL. Whatever that means.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
